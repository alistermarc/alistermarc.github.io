        My passion for mathematics and programming led me first to Data Analytics and later to Artificial Intelligence. I have strong experience across the full data lifecycleâ€”from data engineering and analysis to modeling and deployment. 
        My Masterâ€™s in AI allowed me to master the fundamentals of the field, and Iâ€™m now focusing on natural language processing, particularly on how large language models can drive impact for companies.
